# Astro + React + Yarn PnP

Run `yarn install` then `yarn dev`

Doesn't currently work. It starts, but throws an error when navigating to the dev server:
```
Failed to load "node-fetch"!
ESM format is not natively supported in "node@v16.9.0".
Please use CommonJS or upgrade to an LTS version of node above "node@12.17.0".
